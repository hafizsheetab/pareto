# FAQ

## Register / install / auth

**What's the full sign-up flow?**
Three steps, in order: (1) register at [app.oriqx.com](https://app.oriqx.com) with the invite code your organiser gave you (`hackathon-<tier>-XXXXXXXX`) — a default API key is auto-minted; (2) confirm the activation email; (3) sign in. If you'll use **Studio** (browser), you're done — the key is already injected into the workspace. If you'll use the SDK locally, open **Downloads** in the sidebar and click **"Lost your key? Regenerate"** to reveal a fresh key (`uxk_...`) once.

**Where do I get an invite code?**
From your hackathon organiser. Without one you cannot register at `app.oriqx.com`.

**Where do I find my API key?**
Two places, depending on path. In **Studio**, the key is already exported as `UNIQX_API_KEY` inside the workspace pod — run `echo $UNIQX_API_KEY` in the terminal to confirm. For local SDK use, open the **Downloads** page (sidebar) and click **"Lost your key? Regenerate"**; the new key is shown once. The legacy `/api-keys` page is admin-only now and is not where regular hackathon users get a key.

**`pip install` says 401 Unauthorized.**
Your `UNIQX_API_KEY` is wrong, expired, or not exported in the current shell. Re-export it and re-run. The install URL embeds the key — be careful not to paste it into shared logs.

**My budget shows $0.**
Either you have not redeemed an invite code, or your tier has exhausted its budget. The dashboard shows the remaining figure. Ping your organiser.

## Connecting

**`connect()` raises `UNAUTHENTICATED` or `PERMISSION_DENIED`.**
You never ran `uniqx.login()` (or never exported `UNIQX_API_KEY` before the first run), or the stored key is wrong/expired. The first cell of every starter notebook calls `uniqx.login(os.environ["UNIQX_API_KEY"], gateway=...)`, which writes the key to `~/.config/uniqx/credentials.json` (chmod 0600) and sets the in-process env. After that first run the env var is no longer required — subsequent kernels read the credentials file. Re-export `UNIQX_API_KEY` and re-run the first cell to refresh.

**`login()` raises `KeyError: 'UNIQX_API_KEY'`.**
You haven't exported the key yet. Either `export UNIQX_API_KEY=uxk_...` in the shell that launched Jupyter (not just in `.bashrc`), or run `uniqx login uxk_...` from the terminal once — the notebook will then pick it up from the credentials file.

**`connect()` raises `UNAVAILABLE`.**
The default gateway in the starters is `api.oriqx.com:443` (production). Override via `export UNIQX_GATEWAY=…` if your organiser pointed you at staging (`dev-api.oriqx.com:443`) or a local stack (`localhost:50050`). The local gateway runs with `UNIQX_AUTH_OPTIONAL=1` so the `uniqx.login()` call is a no-op there — you can leave it in.

**The notebook submits but `get()` times out.**
Default timeout is 300 s. For large workloads pass `timeout=None` or a longer value: `uniqx.get(job_id, client=client, timeout=600)`.

## `preflight()`

**`options.summary()` shows only one row.**
The engine found one viable execution plan for your graph. This is normal for very small workloads. Increase problem size to see more options.

**`options.recommended` is `None`.**
The engine returned no options. This usually means the traced module is empty or the gateway hit an internal error. Check `module.to_text()` is non-trivial and re-run.

**No `qpu` row appears.**
Either the workload has no quantum-amenable structure, or the platform's QPU pool is currently sized to zero for the hackathon. A purely classical submission is fully valid — the hackathon does not require quantum.

## SDK semantics

**`runtime_inputs` complains about length mismatch.**
The traced module's function expects N parameters. You passed M values. Inspect with `module.functions[0].params`. The chemistry modules expect 6 flat lists (exps, coeffs, centers, ang, atom_coords, charges) — see `tracks/dft/starter.ipynb`.

**Can I use NumPy inside `@uniqx.to_module`?**
No. The decorator traces operations into IR; calling NumPy at trace time computes locally and breaks the abstraction. Use `uniqx.ops` for anything inside the decorated function. NumPy is fine in your baseline, your setup code, and your post-processing.

**Can I send precomputed matrices as `runtime_inputs`?**
Yes — that's how the MD track ships the precomputed `X`, `g_J`, `g_K`, `H` matrices into the SCF loop module. The rule is about not bypassing tracing with hidden compute, not about input shapes. Big inputs are slow to serialize; prefer building structure inside the trace when you can.

## Submission

**My PR's CI is failing.**
Run `ruff check tracks/ submissions/` locally. The lint catches the common cases: malformed `results.json`, unexecuted notebook cells, missing `preflight_log.txt`.

**I want to submit multiple variants.**
One PR per team. Put variants under `submissions/<team-handle>/<variant-name>/` and nominate one in the PR description. Others are bonus material.

**Can I submit after the deadline?**
Your PR must be *opened* before the deadline. Pushes to an open PR are accepted up to the close of judging. Cutting it close is a Robustness liability — earlier is better.
